### Background
Harnesses the power of [fast-style-transfer](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer), as implemented by [Logan Engstrom](https://github.com/lengstrom), in an attempt to create new art. Existing style models are recombined and iteratively used to explore the possibilities using this framework. 

### Example
